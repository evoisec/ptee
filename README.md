Hadoop Performance Testing Suite - Business Level Workload Emulation, while remaining Close to the Metal - Scala Based

There is a lack of modern, business level tools for workload performance testing on Hadoop. Carried on by inertia, the majority 
of the IT industry is still using archaic, outadted "benchmarks" the majority of which are writtent in Map Reduce 
(not used almost at all in real projects) and implementing "toy" algorithms / data processing like e.g. "sorting" (as in "TerraSort") 

The purpose of this suite is to fill the gap by complementing more modern suites such as:
