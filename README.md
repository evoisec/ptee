Hadoop Performance Testing & Measurement Suite - Business Level Workload Emulation, while remaining Close to the Metal - Scala Based

Enables the generation of Actionable (Measurement) Information supporting Informed Capacity Planning as well as Predictive Models for Performance Scaling and Cluster Sizing

Apache JMETER is used for Test Scenario Workflow Automation

There is a lack of modern, business level tools for workload performance testing on Hadoop. Carried on by inertia, the majority 
of the IT industry is still using archaic, outadted "benchmarks" the majority of which are writtent in Map Reduce 
(not used almost at all in real projects) and implementing "toy" algorithms / data processing like e.g. "sorting" (as in "TerraSort") 

The purpose of this suite is to fill the gap by augmenting (ie provides some innovations) and complementing more modern performance measurement suites (however not maintained on a regular basis / not up to date) such as:
